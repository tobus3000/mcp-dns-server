  # DNS Extranet Setup Guide
  
  This guide explains how to set up a DNS Extranet configuration, which allows external partners or clients to access specific internal resources securely through DNS resolution.
  
  ## Overview
  A DNS Extranet enables controlled access to internal services for external entities while maintaining security boundaries. It typically involves setting up split DNS, conditional forwarding, or DNS delegation.
  
  ## Prerequisites
  - Internal DNS infrastructure (Windows Server DNS, BIND, etc.)
  - Network connectivity between internal and external networks
  - Security policies defined for external access
  - Domain name for the extranet zone
  
  ## Configuration Steps
  
  ### 1. Plan Your DNS Structure
    - Define the domain namespace for your extranet
    - Determine which internal resources need extranet access
    - Identify security requirements and access controls
  
  ### 2. Set Up DNS Zones
    - Create a separate zone for extranet resources
    - Configure conditional forwarding if needed
    - Set up appropriate resource records (A, CNAME, SRV, etc.)
  
  ### 3. Configure Security
    - Implement DNS query filtering if available
    - Set up appropriate firewall rules
    - Consider DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT) for encrypted queries
  
  ### 4. Test the Configuration
    - Verify external DNS resolution works correctly
    - Test access to internal resources from extranet
    - Validate security controls are functioning
  
  ## Best Practices
  - Use dedicated DNS servers for extranet zones
  - Implement monitoring and logging for extranet DNS queries
  - Regularly review and audit access permissions
  - Keep DNS servers updated with security patches
  - Consider implementing DNSSEC for authentication and integrity
