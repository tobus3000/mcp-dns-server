  # DNS Security Best Practices
  
  This document outlines essential security practices for DNS infrastructure to protect against common threats and vulnerabilities.
  
  ## DNS Security Threats
  
  ### Common Attack Vectors
    - DNS Cache Poisoning/Spoofing
    - DNS Amplification Attacks (DDoS)
    - DNS Tunneling
    - Domain Hijacking
    - DNS-based Malware Distribution
  
  ## Best Practices
  
  ### 1. Implement DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
    - Enable DNSSEC to provide authentication and integrity
    - Use strong cryptographic algorithms (RSA, ECDSA)
    - Regularly rotate DNSSEC keys
    - Monitor DNSSEC validation status
  
  ### 2. Secure DNS Server Configuration
    - Run DNS servers with minimal privileges
    - Hide version information
    - Limit recursive queries to authorized clients
    - Restrict zone transfers to authorized servers only
    - Use TSIG for secure dynamic updates
  
  ### 3. Network Security
    - Filter DNS traffic at network boundaries
    - Implement DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT)
    - Use DNS firewalls to block malicious domains
    - Monitor for unusual DNS query patterns
  
  ### 4. Monitoring and Logging
    - Enable detailed DNS query logging
    - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
    - Monitor DNS server performance
    - Regularly audit DNS configurations and access logs
  
  ### 5. Access Control
    - Implement proper access controls for DNS management
    - Use strong authentication for DNS administration
    - Limit administrative access to DNS servers
    - Regularly review and update access permissions
  
  ### 6. DNS Infrastructure Design
    - Deploy geographically distributed DNS servers
    - Use authoritative and recursive servers separately
    - Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
    - Regularly update DNS software and apply security patches
  
  ## DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT)
  
  ### Implementation Guidelines:
    - Configure DoH/DoT endpoints for encrypted DNS resolution
    - Use proper certificates and maintain certificate lifecycles
    - Ensure performance impact is acceptable
    - Plan for certificate renewal and key rotation
  
  ## DNS Response Rate Limiting (RRL)
    - Configure RRL to mitigate DNS amplification attacks
    - Tune RRL parameters based on traffic patterns
    - Monitor RRL effectiveness regularly
  
  ## Incident Response
    - Develop DNS-specific incident response procedures
    - Maintain contact information for DNS stakeholders
    - Have backup DNS configurations ready
    - Establish communication protocols for DNS incidents
