  # DNS Troubleshooting: Common Issues and Solutions
  
  This guide covers the most common DNS issues and their solutions. Use this as a reference when diagnosing DNS problems.
  
  ## Common DNS Issues
  
  ### 1. DNS Resolution Failure
    **Symptoms**: Hostnames not resolving to IP addresses
    **Possible Causes**:
      - Incorrect DNS server configuration
      - Network connectivity issues to DNS servers
      - Missing or incorrect DNS records
      - DNS server not running
  
    **Solutions**:
      - Verify DNS server settings on the client
      - Test connectivity to DNS servers (ping, telnet)
      - Check DNS server logs for errors
      - Verify DNS records exist and are correct
      - Restart DNS service if necessary
  
  ### 2. Slow DNS Resolution
    **Symptoms**: Long delays when resolving hostnames
    **Possible Causes**:
      - High DNS server load
      - Recursive query loops
      - Network latency issues
      - DNS cache problems
  
    **Solutions**:
      - Check DNS server performance and resource usage
      - Review DNS forwarding configuration
      - Implement DNS caching where appropriate
      - Clear DNS cache if stale
  
  ### 3. Incorrect DNS Records
    **Symptoms**: Hostnames resolving to wrong IP addresses
    **Possible Causes**:
      - Typo in DNS record
      - DNS cache with outdated information
      - Incorrect zone configuration
  
    **Solutions**:
      - Verify DNS record in the management interface
      - Clear DNS cache on clients and servers
      - Check zone transfer settings
      - Review DNS delegation configuration
  
  ### 4. DNSSEC Validation Failures
    **Symptoms**: DNSSEC validation errors
    **Possible Causes**:
      - Key mismatch
      - Outdated DNSKEY or DS records
      - Time synchronization issues
  
    **Solutions**:
      - Verify DNSSEC key configuration
      - Check time synchronization
      - Update DNSSEC records as needed
  
  ## Troubleshooting Commands
  
  ### Linux/Unix:
    ```bash
    # Test DNS resolution
    dig example.com
    nslookup example.com
    host example.com
  
    # Check DNS server configuration
    cat /etc/resolv.conf
  
    # Check DNS cache
    sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches  # For systemd-resolved
    ```
  
  ### Windows:
    ```cmd
    # Test DNS resolution
    nslookup example.com
    Resolve-DnsName example.com  # PowerShell
  
    # Check DNS cache
    ipconfig /displaydns
    ipconfig /flushdns
  
    # Test connectivity to DNS server
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 8.8.8.8 -Port 53
    ```
  
  ## Advanced Debugging
  - Use packet capture tools (Wireshark, tcpdump) to analyze DNS traffic
  - Check DNS server logs for detailed error messages
  - Verify firewall rules allow DNS traffic (UDP/TCP port 53)
  - Test from different network locations to isolate network-specific issues
